# Basic page

The Basic page content type is one that comes out of the box in Drupal. However, we have modify it so it meets the requirements of your website. The Basic page is a versatile content type which is the base for building simple and creative pages.

## Building a basic page

A basic page is is used to create page with any type of content. When all you need is to create a page to write lengthy or little content, the basic page is what you need. In addition, if you want to add content to the page's sidebar, or add some components in between its content, the basic page is your friend. Let's start by building a simple page.

1. Click the **Content** link from the admin toolbar
2. Click the **Add content** button
3. Click **Basic page** from the list of content types

The Basic page is divided into **Content** and **Sidebar** sections. It is important to note that the **Title** field is the only required field in the Basic page.

1. Type a title for the page (i.e. About our organization)
2. From the _Content category_, select the appropriate category for the page you are creating. The category is used to define the page's URL and breadcrumb. More on this later.
3. Type the content of the page within the **Body** field. Here you can add text, images, videos, etc.
4. Ignore all other fields and scroll to the bottom of the page
5. Ensure the **Published** checkbox is checked unless you are writing a draft of the page and plan on publishing it later.
6. Click the **Save** button

The new page will be created. Notice the page's URL and breadcrumb reflect the hierarchy we assigned when we picked the category.

## Adding a Sidebar to the page

A sidebar is a great way to add related content to the page's main content. You can add Call To Actions or CTAs, images or list of links related to the page's content.

1. While still in the page you created, click the **Edit** tab. This brings you back to the edit mode of the page.
2. Click the **Sidebar** tab. You will notice the **Add component** button is the only available option.
3. Click **Add component**. The list of components here has been customized to only allow components appropriate for a sidebar.
4. Click the **Button** component from the list of components
5. Fill out the URL field by either searching for existing content in your site, or by typing an external link. You can find internal content by starting to type in the URL field and you will get a series of suggestions for pages to choose from.
6. Type the link text which will become the label of the button (i.e. See more resources)
7. Finally, select a button style. You can continue to adding more components but for now this will do.
8. Click the **Save** button

You will notice the new button has been added to the page's sidebar.

## Adding components to the content region

The same we did in the Sidebar, components can also be added to the main content region of the page. The components available in this region are a little more elaborate since we have more room to play with.

1. Edit the page you created and select the **Add component** button
2. For this example I am going to select the **Embed video** component
3. Fill in the Title of the video. This is optional
4. Click the **Add media** button. You will be presented with two ways to add videos: one, paste the URL of the Youtube or Vimeo video you wish to embed, and two, you can select an existing video from the site's library.
5. I am going to paste the URL from a Youtube video in the corresponding field and click the **Add** button
6. Click **Save** then **Insert selected**
7. Scroll to the bottom and click **Save** to save the page. This should display the page with the embedded video you selected.
