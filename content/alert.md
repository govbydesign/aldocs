# Alert

Alerts are intended to display important and sometimes urgent messages your website visitors. The alert is displayed at the very top of the website and they are presented with different background colors. The background color depends on the type of alert. See below.

## Alerts types

Alerts are a great way to convery a message to visitors of something unusual or delicate they should be aware of. Using the same kind of alert for all situations looses the urgency a message may require. For this reason, we have color-coded various types of alerts to ensure they capture the attention of visitors.

### Information only alert

This is the most common alert which is used simply to inform your website visitors of upcoming or non-urgent changes or updates. The updates could include local rules changes, closing of your organization for observing of upcoming holiday, etc..

### Scheduled alert

If you know ahead of time that a critical computer system your visitors relay on, will need to be restarted or shutdown for a period of time due to schedule maintenance or a needed upgrade, this is the alert you need to use.

### Outage alert

This type of alert is as a response to an unplanned or unexpected system outage. It is to inform visitors that a critical computer system is unavailable for unknown reasons and that your team is working on restoring normal functionality.

This is the highest type of alert which informs visitors of a highly critical message such as active shooter, emergency shutdown of your institution due to potential danger, or an ongoing pandemic situation.
