![Example of News article](../.gitbook/assets/news.png)

## Creating News Articles

1. From your website's administrative toolbar (top of your site), click the **Content** link
2. Click the **Add content** button
3. Click **News** from the available options
4. The **Title** field is required (denoted by a red asterisk)
5. **Image**: To enhance the look of your news article, you can upload an image which will serve as the article's banner, but it will also become the article's thumb when news are displayed as a card. Large wide images are preferred.
6. **News type**: Categorizing news articles allows for articles to be displayed in different ways. Select the type of news from the dropdown.
7. The **Body** field accepts not only text but also images and other elements such as tables, lists, videos and more.
8. **Tags**: Tagging of articles at this time is not being implemented.
9. **Published**: Checking this box will publish the article as soon as you press Save. Clearing this box, will create a draft of the article after you click save and will not be visible to visitors. Creating drafts is a great way to prepare content ahead of time and publshing it when the time is right.

### Other Article Settings:

* **Revisions**: Revisions are like saving backups of your content. The **Revisions log messages** box (Fig. 1)allows you to type a message about the article which later can be used to identify what changes were made to the article. Revisions can be used to return your content to an earlier state.

* **Menu Settings**: Articles can be linked to other pages (Fig. 2).
  * Click-open the **Menu Settings** fieldset
  * Toggle on the **Provide a menu link** toggle
  * The **Menu link title** field will automatically be populated by the article title. However this can also be altered if you wish to use a shorter or different title for the link than the title of the article.
  * The d**escription** field content will display if you hover the link of that page on the site
  * The **Parent link** dropdown is where you select what page this content will be linked to.
  * **Weight**: This is a numeric value which determined the order in which links will be ordered. For example, let's say you have 3 links under the About Us page, the weight of each link determines which link be at the top or bottom. The higher the value the heavier it is considered meaning it will sink more and therefore it will go to the bottom of the list.

* **URL Alias** are automatically generated based on pre-defined patterns. In some cases however, they may need to be set manually for various reasons (Fig 3).
  * To manually set the URL, toggle the _Generate automatic URL alias_ toggle off
  * Type the new desired URL in the provided field.

* **Author Information** provides options to choose an author of the article. By default the **Author by** will be the person currently logged in writing the article. But in some cases you may want to designate someone else as the author if for example you are displaying articles by author. For example an administrative assistance may designate his/her boss as the author.
* **Author on** is where you can specify a date and time of when the article was written/drafted. By default it will be the current date/time, but if you wish to display the article's date and time with a different date you can manually make the update. An example of this is if you are drafting an article so ahead of time but you don't want to publish until a specific date. Setting the publish date manually will display the article with that date as its publish date.
* **Promote Information.** This is not something you will be needing to update.
