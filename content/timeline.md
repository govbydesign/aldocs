### Create a timeline

1. From your website's administrative toolbar (top of your site), click the **Content** link
2. Click the **Add content** button
3. Select **Timeline** from the list of options
4. Type a **Timeline title** for your page
5. Upload a **Hero** image to use at the top of your timeline page. ideally the image should be at least 1600px wide
6. Type a **Subheading** for your hero
7. Click the **Add component** button and select from a hand-ful of components
8. Two of the best components to add to a Timeline page are **Event breaker** and **Event split**
9. These components allow you to build a timeline down the page by switching the event split left to right and right to left. Look at other existing Timeline pages for ideas of how to build a visually appealing timeline page.
10. **Save** your page as usual.
