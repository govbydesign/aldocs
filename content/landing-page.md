# Landing page

A landing page is a very important type of page. It serves as the primary destiination for any of the site's main sections. For example, if you click either _For Attorneys_, _Representing yourself_, _Our Judges_, or any of the other main categories from the main navigation, you will land on a "Landing page" (no pun intended).

## Creating a landing page

Creating a landing page is a very simple process. It's basically adding components. You can add as many components as your heart desires and then you can arrange the components in any order you wish. Let's try it.

1. As usual, from the top admin navigation, click **Content**
1. Click the **Add content** button
1. Select/click _Landing page_ from the available options
1. Type a title for the page, this is a required field
1. Click the **Add component** button

The Add component screen is the same for any page, but what changes is the components that are available. These depend on the type of page, or the page section you try to add components. Let's start by adding a full breaker.

1. From the list of components, scroll until you find _Full breaker_. FYI: Each component has a short description of its use and expected behavior.
1. First start by adding an image which will expand full width. If you notice the help text under the _Add media_ field tells you the expected dimensions of the image you should upload or select from the library. Select and insert the image.
1. The category allows you to add a label or tag to the breaker like "Latest News", "Press release", "Resources", etc.
1. Type a title to display over the full width image. This is a required field.
1. The subheading field is a multi-line field where you can type a bried description of text teaser.
1. Finally, add the link and button text for the optional button or CTA.
1. Click **Save** to add the component to the page. Alternatively, you can add more components before saving the page.

If you saved the page, you should see an image expanded full width with a nice semi-transparent overlay.  All the info you provided should display over the image.
