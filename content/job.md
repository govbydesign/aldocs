# Job

Job postings are a special type of content with very unique information descriptions.&#x20;

### Creating a job posting

1. From your website's administrative toolbar (top of your site), click the **Content** link
2. Click the **Add content** button
3. Select **Job** from the list of options
4. **Job title**: Provide the title of the job posting you are promoting
5. **Classification level**: If one exists, provide the classification level
6. **Open date** and **Close date:** If there is no close date, leave it blank which means "Open until filled"
7. **Salary:** Enter the salary for the job such as **$88,333 - $105,999**
8. **Job description**: Here's where all the remaining details about the job are entered. As best practice, create sub-hearings for breaking down content sections such as **Position overviews, Duties, Qualifications, Benefits**, etc. This will make your posting easier to read.
9. **Published**: If the job needs to be online right away, check the **Published** checkbox, otherwise clear the checkbox
10. Click the **Save** button.

#### Sidebar

If you wish to add supporting information or components on the posting's sidebar, click the **Sidebar** tab and add components are needed.
