# Frequently asked questions

Frequently asked questions or FAQ, are essential on sites that provide products or services. The site provides a FAQ system which is integrated to several content types meaning that if you create for example a basic page, you will see at the end of the page the option to add FAQs and they will be displayed at the bottom of the page below all other content on the page.

Alternatively, you can create a page expecifically to store all FAQs for your site. Regardless of how you wish to create them, the FAQs creation process is the same.
