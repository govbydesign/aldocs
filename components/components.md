# Components

Components are the building blocks of the website. They are reusable and provide several customization options so they can adapt to different use cases.
A component can be as small as a button or link, and big like the entire section of a page.

Each component has been built to perform a specific function which means each component is unique. However, some components are flexible or general enough that could be used in different use cases.

## Adding components to a page

Adding a component to a page is a pretty straight forward process but it requires a good understanding of the content you are about to add and known the best component for the job.

1. Each component has a set of customization options or styles. You can find these by clicking the **Styles** tab while editing the component. Styles you could expect to see on components include:
    * Top/Bottom margin
