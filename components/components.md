# Adding components

Each component has been built to perform a specific function which means that the options and fields you are presented with will vary from component to component.
1. Each component has a set of customization options or styles. You can find these by clicking the **Styles** tab while editing the component. Styles you could expect to see on components include:
    * Top/Bottom margin
    * Top/Bottom padding
    * Background color
    * Alignment settings
    * Text color or text size, and others.
