# CTA Card

Often times, content managers may want to provide links for content and want the links to stand out from the rest of the content of a page.  CTA Cards (call to action), are great for this purpose.  They serve as a teaser to content that may exist on your website or a completely separate website.  CTA cards can be added individually or as a group of up to 3.  Each card can be customized with different colors from a pre-selected list of colors. &#x20;

A CTA card accepts a title which is styled so it stands out, a teaser body text to describe the item you are trying to link, and a button that provides the link to the page you wish to link.  The button's text can be customized to read anything you wish (i.e. Learn more, Read more, Get informed, Read all about it, etc.)
