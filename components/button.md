# Button

There are times when you need a link to stand out or have an important call to action you want to make sure it is not missed. Using a button component is very effective and also visually appealing

The fields that make up the button include:

* `url`: This is where you either select a page that already exist you want to direct visitors to or, you can type an external address.
* `link text`: This is the label of the button. Keep this short and precise. For example: See our resources, Read our procedures, etc.
* `button style`: There are two options to choose from, Gold and Transparent

## Creating a Button

A button is no different than the links we've seen in other components.

1. While on any page where you wish to add a quote, click the **Edit** tab to begin the editing process.
1. Once you are in the edit screen, click the **Add component** button.
1. In the **Media** category you should see the button at the top of the list, click on it to add it to the page
1. Fill out the **URL** and **Text link** fields. Remember, if you are linking to an internal page (A page that already exists in your site), you simply start typing the title of the page (or part of the title), and you will see a list of suggestions to pick from. If you need to link to an external site, type the full address of the site (i.e. https://google.com).
1. Select a button style from the list. Depending on whether this is a very important link, you could choose gold, or if this is a normal link but wish to display it styled as a button, select "transparent". If you don't make a choice by default you will get a gold button.
1. Click **Save** to save the page.

You should see the new button displayed on the page.

### Tip

Adding a button on a page's sidebar is a great way to callout an important piece of content.
