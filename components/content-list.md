# Content list

The Content List component is great to showcase articles that are relevant to the audience of the site or a specific page.  The content list component allows content managers to hand-pick articles of type News or Procedures to display in a card format. &#x20;

Let's say we have a Human Resources pages, we can add a Content List component where we can call out the top 3 articles that are important to visitors of the page to see.  Each section of articles can have a unique heading such as **Featured content, Important Articles, Latest Procedures,** etc.

In addition, there is no limit on how many of these sections you can display on a given page.  You can have multiple sections of articles each of which would be labeled with a unique heading.
