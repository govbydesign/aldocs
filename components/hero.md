## Creating a Hero

Although the hero component on the site provides options for entering text and adding a button, the Hero's only purpose is to display a gallery of images that cycle though automatically, but also provide controls for visitors to change them at will.

1. While on any page where you wish to add a Hero, click the **Edit** tab to begin the editing process.
2. Once you are in the edit screen, click the **Add component** button.
3. From the **Media** category, click the **Hero** component. You should be presented with several fields. As previously indicated, the only field we use is the **Image** field. The rest are ignored.
4. Click the **Add media** button and select one or more images yo uwish to be part of your Hero component.
5. Press **Insert selected**
6. Press the **Save** button to save the page.
