# Links list

The Links List component is probably one of the most popular ones because it allows content managers to create lists of links.  Each list can have a unique, color-coded title with a companion icon that represent the type of links gathered in the list.  Content managers can create a list of links with as many links as needed.  Lists can be created individually or as a collection as shown below.

Links inside each list can be internal (to content that exists in your website), or external to completely separate websites.
