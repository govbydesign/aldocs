# List slider

The List slider component is currently only being used for Oral Histories. This component allows you to gather a series of articles of type Oral Histories, and organize them in any order you wish. Upon saving the component, the articles you selected are then presented in a slider manne where you can cycle through them. Each article's title is a link to the full Oral History Article or page.
