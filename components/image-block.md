# Image block

The image block component is a simple component which only displays an image to be used as an ornament and visually improve the look of a page. The image is styled with a gold frame on the top-left and bottom-right corners to make it more visually appealing.

<div align="left">

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image-block.png" alt="Image block" width="375">

</div>

* `image`: This is the only field available in the image block component.
* `caption`: Optional caption for the image
