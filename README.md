### Breaking the guide down

In an effort to provide you with a well-structured guide, we have grouped the content of it in three different groups:

1. Knowing your components
2. Drupal entities
3. Managing content

Each of the three groups above is filed with great content that will help you fully understand not only the architecture and layout of your website, but also how to become more efficient in managing the content that is so critical to your visitors.

Before we get too deep into the training, let's start by understanding the technologies used to build your website. Let's go over a few concepts that will be essential when working with your website.

## What is Drupal?

Drupal is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) that allows users to create and maintain websites.

Drupal is suitable for building simple or complex websites, and it's useful for developers, marketers, sales people, educators, and digital agencies.

If you've never heard of Drupal before, let's put it in context so we at least understand the role that it plays in your organization. Drupal is a competitor to systems like SharePoint, WordPress, and other CMS. Drupal is a powerful, secured, and escalable, enterprise level content management system.

## Who uses Drupal?

Drupal is one of the most used CMS in the world and it powers some of the world's most noticeable websites in all verticals and industries, including higher education, government, healthcare, non-for-profit, media, and other.

This is a guide to provide step-by-step instructions on how to work with Drupal and manage content.
