# Media

Your website offers a media management system which allows you to upload various types of media such as images, files, and videos, and reuse them as many time as needed without having to upload the same media item twice.&#x20;

Some images require special treatment such as dimensions, resolution, and cropping, the system has been setup so you don't need to concern yourself with any of that. Images have been configured for most use cases so when you add an image to a given component or page, the system should automatically process the image so it displays as you would expect.

A good rule of thumb is to upload images as big as you can. This will allow for those images to be used even on the most extremes scenarios. When you add content to your site and you are faced with an image upload field, you will be provided guidelines for how big the image you upload should be. There are several ways in which you can uploaded images to your site:

1. Upload images through the media management system with the intention of using them at a later  time and by different components
2. Upload images from the specific area where the image will be used. For example, while creating a news article, or creating a breaker component.

These instructions will focus the first scenario above as the second scenario is covered several ways throughout this guide.

### Uploading and storing images for later use

1. From your website's administrative toolbar (top of your site), click the **Content** link
2. Click **Media** from the list of tabs on the page
3. Click the **Add media** button

5. Using the Image upload field, upload one image at a time
6. Provide a helpful and descriptive alt text to each image. This is a good practice for accessibility.
7. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

Any images or other media items you add to the page will become available to you at any time as you are prompted with the **Add media** button on any type of component or page you are working with.
