# Working with media items

Your website offers a media management system which allows you to upload various types of media such as images, files, and videos.

A good rule of thumb when uploading images is to use very big images. This makes it possible to use those images on any use cases.
{% endhint %}

## Ways to upload images

There are two basic ways for uploading images:

1. **Upload to media library**: If you have identified new images you wish to use on the website, you can upload them to the media library so they can be used anywhere on your site.
2. **Upload while creating content**: Many components provide the ability to upload images as you create content. For example, while creating a news article, or creating an Oral History profile, you can upload images which become available for future use.

These instructions will focus the first scenario above as the second scenario is covered several ways throughout this guide.

### Uploading and storing images for later use

1. From your website's admin toolbar (top of your site), click the **Content** link
1. Click **Media** from the list of tabs on the page.
1. Click the **Add media** button.
1. Click **Image**, as the type of media.
1. Using the Image upload field, upload one image at a time
1. Provide a helpful and descriptive alt text for each image. This is a good practice for accessibility.
1. Click the **Save** button.

Images added to the media library become available for use througout the site.
