In Drupal, a block is a container of content that can be displayed on one or more pages of a website

### Content type

A content type in Drupal is a collection fields, that are related by context. When a content editor adds new content to a Drupal site, they are presented with a list of content types to choose from.

### Theme

A Drupal theme is a set of files that control the look and feel of a Drupal-powered website. Themes are visible to users when they view any page in their browser.

### Taxonomy

Taxonomy in Drupal is the practice of organizing and classifying content on a website. Taxonomy terms are individual items within a vocabulary, which is a set of terms. For example, on a blog, a taxonomy vocabulary might be a set of categories, such as "Science," "Lifestyles," and "Travel".

### Module

### Paragraph type

Paragraph types in Drupal are reusable, structured parts of content that allow site builders to create content in a new way. They can include simple text blocks, images, slideshows, image galleries, videos, and more.

### Cache

Drupal cache is a caching layer that stores page and theme elements so they don't need to be recreated each time they are rendered. This allows users to access pages faster and with fewer resources, which is an important part of site optimization.
