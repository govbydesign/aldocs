# Users

User management is one of Drupal's most robust and advanced features.

### Managing Users in Drupal

1. From Drupal's admin toolbar, click the **People** link
2. Click the **Add user** button
3. Fill out the **Email, Username,** and **Password** fields using a strong password
4. For **Status** select either **Active** or **Blocked** depending if this is an active user or you are creating the account for future use.&#x20;
5. For **Role** select the **Editor**. Editor is the designated role for anyone who simply needs to manage content, create new pages, create users. The Administrator role should not be used for these users.
6. Check the box if you wish to notify users about their new account.
7. Check the box to enforce password experiration policies. This is recommended because it forces users to change their password every 90 days.
8. Click the **Create new account** button



{% hint style="info" %}
For security reason, if an account is not being actively used, it's best to set it to **Blocked**.
{% endhint %}
