# Menus

In Drupal, menus are more than just simple links to other pages, they drive the site's content hierarchy as well as URLs and Breadcrumbs within pages.

## Working with menus

Menus can be managed in several ways in Drupal, you can manage them directly in the Menus page, or you can manage them as you create content.

1. From the Admin toolbar, click **Structure** then **Menus**. Here you will see several menus which make up each of the sections of the site.
2. Click the **Edit** link next to the menu you wish to edit. You should see all the links that are part of that particular menu. One thing you can do is change the order in which they display within that menu by dragging links to the order you wish to display them.
3. If you click **Edit** next to a link, you can change the label for the link as well as the url of the page the link goes to.
4. Within the Menu edit page you can also disable individual links by unchecking the **Enabled** checkbox
5. Save your changes.
