# Content types

Content types are web forms with unique fields to create content of a special type such as Job openings, News articles, Procedures, etc.&#x20;

Drupal comes with a hand-full of content types and based on your requirements we have created additional ones including:

* [Alert](../content/alert.md)
* [Basic page](../content/basic-page.md)
* [Job](../content/job.md)
* [Judge](../content/judge.md)
* [Landing page](../content/landing-page.md)
* [News](../content/news.md)
* [Oral History, About Building, Events/Archives](../content/oral-history-about-building-events-archives.md)
* [Timeline](../content/timeline.md)
* [Two column landing page](../content/two-column-landing-page.md)
