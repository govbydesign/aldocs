# Content types

Content types are web forms with unique fields to create content of a special type such as Job openings, News articles, Procedures, etc.&#x20;

Drupal comes with a hand-full of content types and based on your requirements we have created additional ones including:

* [Alert](../content/alert.md)
* [Basic page](../content/basic-page.md)
* Job
* Judge
* [Landing page](../content/landing-page.md)
* [News](../content/news.md)
* Oral History, About Building, Events/Archives
* Timeline
* Two column landing page
