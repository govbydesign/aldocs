# Links

Probably one of the simples yet powerful elements of  a website. There are two types of links you will create: _Internal links_ and _External links_.

**Internal links**: Links to pages that exist in your website.

**External links**: Links to other websites or third party resources.

## Creating Internal links

Adding links will vary depending on whether you are adding them inside a component, page or menu.

**IMPORTANT**: For internal links, you supress the website's domain name and instead only type the page title.

## Creating External links

Creating external links is similar to creating internal links. The only difference is that in the URL field you type or paste the full website address you want to link to. See FIG. 3.
